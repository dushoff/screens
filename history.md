gitroot proceeded screens. It was listed here as legacy, but that link has been or should be deleted, because it confuses me. You can still find it as ~/gitroot

screens mark I used rhdir to try to be fancy about importing. It was the first attempt at dirdirs. It was pretty, but cracked a bit under the strain of covid

This is screens mark II. Anything that was imported into screens mark I is _still here_ (unless it has been moved around by the mark II machinery, in which case you don't need old versions of it)

mark II is driven by the fairly baroque, but so-far robust-ish listdir machinery
